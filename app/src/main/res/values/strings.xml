In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests.[29] He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name \\\"Logan\\\".[30] When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves,[31] until he is captured and placed in a circus.[32] Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion.[33] Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth,[34] he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I. Logan spends time in Madripoor before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu and has a son, Daken. Logan is unaware of his son for many years."</string>

As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and \\\"acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid\\\".[44] Along with super strength, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \\\"Spider-Man\\\", becomes a novelty television star. However, \\\"He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\\\" Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, \\\"With great power there must also come-great responsibility!\\\"[45]"</string>

Blake flees from the aliens into a cave. After discovering Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir (disguised as a walking stick) and striking it against a rock, he transforms into the thunder god.[53] Later, in Thor #159, Blake is revealed to have always been Thor, Odin\'s enchantment having caused him to forget his history as The Thunder God and believe himself mortal.[54]</string>
